# Spring Professional Learning Path
## Family Cash Card <br>
Family Cash Card serviceâ€”an app for families to manage allowances in the form of digital debit cards.

## Main Goal
I developed this application using the concepts from Spring Academy's ['Building a REST API with Spring Boot'](https://spring.academy/courses/building-a-rest-api-with-spring-boot) course.
<br> Despite that, I employed key concepts such as PUT, POST, DELETE, and GET. Spring Academy teaches how TDD works, so I also used TDD to develop this application.
<br> I'm gonna continue learning about Spring and its tools, and implementing improvements in this project.

## TDD (Test Driven Development)
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The TDD process typically involves the following steps:

1. Write a Test: The developer writes a test that defines a small unit of functionality.
2. Run the Test: The test is executed and, since there's no implementation yet, it should fail.
3. Write Code: The developer writes the minimum amount of code required to pass the test.
4. Run Tests: All tests are executed. If the new test and existing tests pass, the development proceeds.
5. Refactor Code: The developer refactors the code to improve its structure, readability, or performance, ensuring that all tests still pass.
6. Repeat: Steps 1-5 are repeated for each new feature or piece of functionality.
   
<br>In summary, TDD advocates for a continuous cycle of writing tests, writing code to pass tests, and refactoring. This approach helps ensure that the codebase remains maintainable, and new features are added without breaking existing functionality.
